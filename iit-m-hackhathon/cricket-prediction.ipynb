    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "- Predict the score of an inning after 6 overs\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "- Dataset downloaded from [CricSheet](https://cricsheet.org/downloads/t20s_male_csv2.zip)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset - Analysis\n",
    "- Its a zip file containing data for all T20 matches played by Men.\n",
    "- There are 999 files each containing below 22 columns.\n",
    "   - match_id\n",
    "   - season\n",
    "   - start_date\n",
    "   - venue\n",
    "   - innings\n",
    "   - ball\n",
    "   - batting_team\n",
    "   - bowling_team\n",
    "   - striker\n",
    "   - non_striker\n",
    "   - bowler\n",
    "   - runs_off_bat\n",

    "   - other_player_dismissed\n",
    "   \n",
    "- As the problem statement is to predict score after first 6 overs, we need to prepare dataset as given below\n",
    "  - Unzip file (t20s_male_csv2.zip) \n",
    "  - Merge data from all the files and load it into dataframe\n",
    "  - Take data till six overs from each innings\n",
    "  - Add a column for total score : Total score per ball = runs_off_bat + extras\n",
    "\n",
    "- For prediction, an input file is provided with 6 columns(venue,innings,batting_team,bowling_team,batsmen,bowlers)\n",
    "  - The dataset does not have information about batsman and bowlers, we need to add two columns for them which holds list of bowler and bastman till 6 overs\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Feature Engineering\n",
    "  - Drop Null values\n",
    "  - One hot encoding for Non numerical columns such as venue, batting team, bowling team, batsman, bowlers\n",
    "  - Convert date to date time object\n",
    "  - Split dataset based on time : Train < 2015 and Test > 2015\n",
    "  - Remove unwanted columns : MatchId, Season, venue, innings, player_dismissed, other_wicket_type, other_player_dismissed etc\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training\n",
    "  - As the objective is to predict a score(a discrete value), its a regression problem in machine learning\n",
    "  - A model could be trained with multiple algorithms such as\n",
    "      - Linear regression\n",
    "      - Ridge regression\n",
    "      - Decision tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testing\n",
    "  - Test the model on the split dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "- Score\n",
    "  - Evaluate score R2. A lower value is preferred\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Prediction\n",
    "  - Make prediction by providing data present in input file\n",
